# Morse Decoder
This device allows you to translate a Morse code signal to its alphanumeric representation. It works by first detecting an incoming signal using an input switch ðŸŽš(using polling or interrupts), then translating and displaying the hidden message in ASCII onto a serial port. It also lights up LEDs based on what signals were received.
